# gtree
gtree is sort of a python port of node-archy in the sense that it allows you to print npm-style trees but it's a bit more than that.

with gtree you can turn nested objects into nice displayable trees, you have to define a function in your object that returns the object children in a list, and you can add extra attributes of the object that don't have child nodes themselves.
